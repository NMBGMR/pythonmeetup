Todo
----
Advanced -
   write a simple class to describe a car. write a set of classes to describe vehicles, car, boat, plane, etc.
   **demonstrate your understanding of inheritance**
   
Advanced/Beginner - 
   write a `hello world` script and run it from pycharm - **demonstrate you can run a python script**
   write a function that tells a car what to do as it approaches a traffic light
     the states are: 1) green == go 2) red == stop and 3) yellow ==? Think about what your definition of yellow would be
     and then try to define using code, i.e if/else statements
     **demonstrate understanding of if/else statements, boolean logic** 
     

Use your discretion in how much you want to populate your function/methods e.g.
```python
def approach_traffic_light(a,b,c,d)
   if a == 'green':
      continue_moving()
      
def continue_moving():
    # no need to fill in anything here. we are not concerned with the actual mechanics of making the car go.
    pass

```
