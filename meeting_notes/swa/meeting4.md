    - write a function takes two lists( or arrays) and col stacks them and returns a new list( or array)
    - write a function takes two lists( or arrays) and row stacks them and returns a new list(or array)

Try with and without using numpy vstack, hstack, etc
  
  ```python
  
  x = [1,2,3]
  y = [10,20,30]
  print row_stack(x,y)
  #  [[1,2,3],
  #   [10,20,30]]
  
  print col_stack(x,y)
  # [[1,10],
  #  [2,20],
  #  [3,30]]
  ```
